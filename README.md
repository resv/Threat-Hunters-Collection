The Threat Hunter's Collection is a single PowerShell script that consolidates a diverse array of tools, a beginning to creating a comprehensive toolkit for cyber threat hunters.

This collection aims to simplify the threat hunting process by providing a single point of access to various tools, eliminating the need for tedious setup, sourcing downloads, or complex commands.

The toolkit promotes portability, allowing hunters to be creative‚Äîwhether on a USB drive, as an email template, or CURL it from a repository for convenient and efficient threat hunting on the go. Explore the tools, contribute to the project, and enhance your threat hunting capabilities with the Threat Hunter's Collection.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Things to note

To be added later.

Signatures - All downloads are checked against SHA256, if they do not match, it was either updated or compromised, use the mirror source, these mirror files are hosted here.

Sysmon - requires a few policy adjustments: enable Audit Process Creation, go straight to the [screenshots](https://mahim-firoj.medium.com/incident-response-and-threat-hunting-using-deepbluecli-tool-bf5d4c52c8a8)
 - This process will be automated in the next release

DeepBlueCLI - Aware of a few bugs
 - This is being worked on..

Pro version - Remote access, EDR or other personal account bound apps
 - Remote Access & EDR is the private pro version for my own use, the code is not included in this repo.

32bit - Apparently, I've come across more 32bit systems that I anticipated..
 - I am incredibly disappointed that I have to accomodate for 32bit systems but that is the world we live in. I will work on including this.

Please always exercise caution, use only if authorized.
